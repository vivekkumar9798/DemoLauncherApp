## Recommended Screenshots

### Main Screens to Capture:
1. **Home Screen** - Show app grid with animations
2. **App Selection** - Show app selection interface
3. **Permission Setup** - Show onboarding flow
4. **Settings/Options** - If available

### Best Practices:
- Use device resolution (1080x1920 or similar)
- Show actual app content, not empty screens
- Ensure good lighting and clarity
- Include status bar for context
- Avoid personal information in screenshots

## Current Placeholder
The current `screenshot.png` is a transparent placeholder. Replace it with actual screenshots for better presentation.

## Multiple Screenshots
For multiple screenshots, create a `screenshots/` directory and update README.md accordingly:

```markdown
## Screenshots

### Home Screen
![Home Screen](screenshots/home.png)

### App Selection
![App Selection](screenshots/selection.png)

### Permissions
![Permissions](screenshots/permissions.png)
```
